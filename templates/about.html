                The formation of <strong><i>Kitchen Genie</i></strong>, grew out out of simple conversations with friends and
                family members who were
                concerned about soaring food prices and their ability to cope with financial stress. As a full stack software
                developer student, I decided to put my coding skills to work and build a money saving food recipe application.
                This is a place where you can share savory, bargin recipes with your friends to help
                dissolve financial fear and empower your bank account.
